### Sun Country Airlines wanted to understand their customers better and improve their online booking channels to meet the expectations of twenty-first century travelers. The main goal was to increase enrollment in their Ufly Rewards program and drive more customers to Sun Country Airlines. To achieve this, the analysis aimed to identify meaningful customer segments to increase Ufly membership and website bookings.

- To accomplish this, the team visualized 3 years of flight data containing over 3 million records to get a better understanding of the dataset. They then aggregated the data into customer-level to focus on the customer-based business problem. In order to reduce noise and improve computational efficiency, they implemented PCA before clustering the customers into meaningful groups based on similar flying traits using K-means.

- The team also analyzed how long it takes to become a Ufly member and combined the cluster solution with the Ufly membership analysis to recommend targeting specific clusters to improve Ufly membership and increase website bookings. These insights allowed Sun Country to understand their customers better and meet their needs through the Ufly membership program.

The analysis resulted in 5 distinct customer clusters.
- Cluster 1 consisted of frequent 1st-class flyers who spent an average of $622 per flight and were the smallest cluster with only 2.4% of all customers. 
- Cluster 2 was made up of one-time low spenders who spent an average of $107 per flight. 
- Cluster 3, the largest cluster with 617,000 customers, consisted of SCA bookers who made over 99% of their bookings from the SCA website or SY vacation. 
- Cluster 4, the outside bookers, consisted of customers who almost exclusively booked from outside channels with a membership proportion of only 11%. 
- Finally, cluster 5, the upgraders, was defined by the percentage of seat upgrades and accounted for 70% of all upgrades among all the clusters.

Overall, the analysis provided Sun Country Airlines with valuable insights into their customer base and allowed them to target specific clusters to increase Ufly membership and website bookings.
