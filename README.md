#### Business Challenge:
Sun Country Airlines aimed to enhance its understanding of customers and optimize online booking channels to boost Ufly Rewards program enrollment and drive more customers to the airline. The overarching goal was to align services with the expectations of contemporary travelers.

### Data Analysis Approach:
To tackle this challenge, the team embarked on a comprehensive analysis of three years of flight data, comprising over 3 million records. The initial step involved visualizing the dataset to gain insights, following which the data was aggregated at the customer level to address the specific customer-centric business problem. To streamline computational efficiency and mitigate noise, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was implemented before applying K-means clustering to identify meaningful customer segments with similar flying traits.

### Membership Duration Analysis:
In addition to clustering, the team delved into understanding the timeframe required for customers to become Ufly members. This information was crucial for aligning cluster solutions with Ufly membership analysis, providing actionable recommendations for targeting specific clusters to enhance Ufly membership and drive website bookings.

### Key Customer Clusters:
The analysis resulted in the identification of five distinct customer clusters, each representing a unique segment of Sun Country Airlines' customer base:

#### Cluster 1 - Elite Flyers: Comprised of frequent 1st-class flyers characterized by an average spending of $622 per flight. Although the smallest cluster (2.4% of customers), they represented a high-value segment.

#### Cluster 2 - One-time Low-Spenders: Consisted of customers who were one-time, low-spenders with an average expenditure of $107 per flight.

#### Cluster 3 - SCA Bookers: The largest cluster (617,000 customers), with over 99% of their bookings originating from the Sun Country Airlines website or SY vacation platform.

#### Cluster 4 - Outside Bookers: Encompassed customers who predominantly booked from external channels, with a relatively low Ufly membership proportion (11%).

#### Cluster 5 - Upgraders: Defined by a high percentage of seat upgrades, accounting for 70% of all upgrades across all clusters.

### Strategic Insights and Recommendations:
Armed with these cluster insights, Sun Country Airlines gained a nuanced understanding of its customer base. This allowed targeted efforts to increase Ufly membership and encourage website bookings. For instance, specific strategies could be devised for each cluster, such as personalized loyalty programs for elite flyers or targeted promotions to convert one-time low-spenders into loyal customers.

### Outcome:
The analysis provided Sun Country Airlines with actionable insights, enabling the airline to refine its marketing and service strategies. By tailoring approaches to specific customer clusters, Sun Country Airlines could enhance the Ufly Rewards program's appeal, increase customer loyalty, and optimize website bookings, thereby meeting the evolving needs of twenty-first-century travelers.
